<h2>I want to <span class="teal">make things</span><br>
that <span class="underline">make a difference</span>.</h2>

I am security-savvy software developer. Who love to work on new technologies and complex problems. 

I help startups and SaaS companies (and occasional others) to write better and secure software. I do this through three servies: roadmapping projects (especially SaaS MVP's), advising on selction of processes and tools, training developers to write high-quality secure software. 

I have about one decade of professional experience in Project management, software development, technology implementation and integration.  Development and implementation in wide variety of vendor products, languages, frameworks, systems, process, techniques, domains, etc. I like to create and deliver briefings and technical trainings. 

On slightly less geeky notes, Below are some random facts
